## **Techniques and Excel Formulas Used** üíª

### **1. Data Cleaning and Transformation** üßπ
- **Duplicate Management**: Employed Excel‚Äôs `Remove Duplicates` function to ensure that only unique customer entries are retained, thus preventing data inconsistencies.
- **Formatting Consistency**: Applied consistent formatting for numbers and dates using the `TEXT` function and custom formats to maintain uniformity throughout the dataset.
    - Example: `=TEXT(A2, "dd-mmm-yyyy")` ensures all dates follow the same format.
- **Text Functions**: Utilized `PROPER`, `TRIM`, and `SUBSTITUTE` to standardize text entries, particularly for customer names, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
    - Example: `=PROPER(TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(A2," ","")))` cleans names by removing extra spaces and correcting capitalization.

### **2. Lookup and Reference Automation** üîó
- **XLOOKUP**: Leveraged for dynamically retrieving related data based on Customer ID, enhancing the dashboard‚Äôs interactivity.
    - Example: `=XLOOKUP(Customer_ID, DataTable[Customer_ID], DataTable[Annual_Income])` pulls annual income based on Customer ID.
- **INDEX MATCH**: Implemented for more complex data retrieval scenarios where XLOOKUP is not applicable, allowing for enhanced flexibility in data analysis.
    - Example: `=INDEX(Table2[Income], MATCH(Customer_ID, Table1[Customer_ID], 0))` facilitates cross-referencing data across different tables.

### **3. Data Enrichment with Power Query** ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Data Cleaning**: Used Power Query to remove null values, rectify inconsistencies, and split full names into first and last names, streamlining the dataset for analysis.
- **Custom Columns**: Added custom columns to derive additional metrics, such as income brackets and loyalty categories, which support segmentation efforts.

### **4. Pivot Tables & Descriptive Analysis** üìä
- **Pivot Tables**: Created to summarize and analyze customer segmentation by demographics such as city, income, and tenure, facilitating deeper insights.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Utilized Excel‚Äôs Data Analysis Toolpak to calculate key statistics (e.g., averages, counts, standard deviations) for various customer groups, enhancing the analytical framework.

### **5. Dynamic Charts and Visualizations** üìà
- **Quadrant Chart for Customer Segmentation**: Developed a scatter plot to visualize income against spending, categorizing customers into four quadrants (e.g., High Income/High Spend).
    - This visualization helps identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Bubble Chart for Loyalty vs. Churn Risk**: Created to illustrate the relationship between loyalty scores and churn risk, with bubble sizes representing monthly spend.
    - This chart highlights high-risk segments that require attention.
- **Churn Probability Heatmap**: Visualized churn risk across demographic attributes using conditional formatting and heatmap color scales, allowing for quick assessments of high-risk groups.
- **Retention by Contract Type (Stacked Column Chart)**: Summarized retention rates by contract type, facilitating insights into which contracts yield better customer loyalty.

### **6. Filtering & Data Validation** üîß
- **Dynamic Dropdown Filters**: Implemented data validation to create dropdowns for filtering by attributes such as city, income bracket, and age group, enhancing user interactivity.
    - Example: 
      ```excel
      =FILTER(Customer_Data[City], Customer_Data[Income_Bracket] = Selected_Bracket)
      ```
- **Interactive Slicers**: Added slicers to enable users to dynamically filter data by various demographic groups, promoting a user-friendly interface for exploration.

## **Findings & Insights** üîç

### **1. High-Value Customers**:
- **Insight**: Customers in the high-income, high-spend quadrant demonstrate significantly lower churn risk. Targeted marketing efforts can focus on retaining these valuable segments through personalized outreach and loyalty programs.

### **2. Churn Risk**:
- **Insight**: Customers exhibiting lower loyalty scores coupled with medium spending are identified as being at a higher risk of churn. Implementing targeted retention strategies, such as personalized loyalty rewards, may mitigate this risk.

### **3. Contract Type and Retention**:
- **Insight**: Data indicates that customers with long-term contracts (e.g., annual subscriptions) exhibit higher retention rates. Providing incentives for transitioning customers to longer-term agreements can enhance overall retention.

### **4. Customer Spending & Tenure**:
- **Insight**: Analysis reveals that while monthly spending typically increases during the initial years of a customer‚Äôs tenure, it plateaus after three years. This suggests that businesses should focus on engaging customers in the early stages to maximize lifetime value.
